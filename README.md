# Final Project Repository
**INFO-201: _Intro to Data Programming_ (Winter 2023)**

This app aims to determine the potential relationship between social and economic factors and students' academic success.
The dataset is pulled from Kaggle.com, titled "Predict students' dropout and academic success". Main variables used are
age of students, curriculum grades, father's occupation, nationality, unemployment rate, GDP, inflation rate and status of
students enrollment. Two scatter plots and one table facilitate to display the relationship between variables. All files
can be found under the github repository, and shiny app acts as an online platform to exhibit our codes into a real app to
the public.
