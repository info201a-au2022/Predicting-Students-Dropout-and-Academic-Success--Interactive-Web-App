This data was collected by four authors, Valentim Realinho, Jorge Machado, Luis Baptista, and Monica V. Martins. We accessed this data through the website Kaggle. For undergraduate students in a variety of fields, this dataset contains information on their socioeconomic status, academic achievement, and demographics. It can be used to examine how various variables may affect academic success and dropout rates. Information such as the application method, course preference, grades, and economic indicators like the unemployment and inflation rates are all included. This dataset, which may be used across disciplines, offers insightful information about the factors that influence students' decision to continue their education or leave it early."),
